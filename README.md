# Particle Swarm Optimization with CUDA 

# TODO
- [ ] Datastructures for a rapid evaluation function in the **CUDA kernel**
        - [x] Best solution would be to keep the start indeces per device, to reduce computational time

- [ ] Particle swarm algorithm itself
- [ ] Implementation in GUI (Tauri test on ubuntu)
